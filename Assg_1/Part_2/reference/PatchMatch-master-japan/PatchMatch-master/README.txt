PatchMatch
================

PatchMatch algorithm for MATLAB. I referenced mostly [1].
(not "generalized" version.)

It is only for grayscale image! Modification of color image is future work #3.

.mex file (C++ codes) are not included. This is implemented for MATLAB only.
Though .mex or C++ is much faster then MATLAB and PatchMatch algorithm is a little hard to parallelize,
we have no intention of implementing in .mex or C++.
